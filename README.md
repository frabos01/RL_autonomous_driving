# RL project Autonomous Driving

PyTorch implementation of different RL approaches to autonomous driving in Gymnasium highway environment, focusing on safety, efficiency, and adaptability. The RL agent is trained using different Deep RL algorithms to make real-time driving decisions, including lane changes, acceleration, and maintaining safe distances.
The implemented approaches are: Heuristic Baseline, Manual Control, PPO Clip, Double DQN and Dueling DQN with PER.
The files for training and evaluation are present.
The best model is saved.
